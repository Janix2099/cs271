    five topics related to computing (maybe an interesting looking data structure?!) that interest you, maybe even include a link to a page talking about the topic both in this README file and on the discord channel for this class
- AI is probably the most interesting topic, and will define the generations to come
- I really liked working on CSS
- Python is where I have had my most fun
- Modding games as a hobby feels very feasible now, and I have already implemented this practice a lot
- cyber security and its functions are very neat for me

    five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,
- I still do not have a solid understanding of data structures, and I definitely should review those more
- Creating good test functions is hard for me, and I usually have to end up looking for help. Normally I just check it manually and spend an hour making tests for the assignments, but I know I shouldn't be doing that.
- Big O notation is something I still need to work on
- Coding interviews I need to practice
- Need to increase my work speed
